# Philosophy 哲学殿堂

> There is a pleasure in philosophy, and a lure even in the mirages of metaphysics, which every student feels until the coarse necessities of physical existence drag him from the heights of thought into the mart of economic strife and gain. Most of us have known some golden days in the June of life when philosophy was in fact what Plato calls it, "that dear delight"; when the love of a modestly elusive Truth seemed more glorious, incomparably, than the lust for the ways of the flesh and the dross of the world. And there is always some wistful remnant in us of that early wooing of wisdom. "Life has meaning," we feel with Browning— "to find its meaning is my meat and drink." So much of our lives is meaningless, a self- cancelling vacillation and futility; we strive with the chaos about us and within; but we would believe all the while that therie is something vital and significant in us; could but decipher our own souls. We want to understand: 'life means for us constantly to transform into light and flame all that we are or meet with"; we are like Mitya in 'The Brothers Karamazov''— "one of those who don't want millions, but an answer to their questions"; we want to seize the value and perspective of passing things, and so to pull ourselves up out of the maelstrom of daily circumanstance. We want to know that the little things are little, the big things big before it is too late; we want to see things now as they will seem forever —— "in the light of eternity." We want to learn to laugh in the face of the inevitable, to smile even at the looming of death. We want to be whole, to coordinate our energies by criticizing and harmonizing our desires; for coordinated energy: is the last word in ethics and politics, and perhaps in logic and meta-physics too. "To be a philosopher," said Thoreau, "is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as tp live, according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust." We may be sure that if we can but find wisdom, all things else will be added unto us. "Seek ye first the good things of the mind," Bacon admonishes us, "and the rest will either be sup- plied or its loss will not be felt." Truth will not make us rich, but it will make us free.

哲学里自有一种乐趣，甚至连形而上学的幻影也是那么引人入胜，这种乐趣是每一个学者都可以领略到的。尽管欲望会把我们从思想的天堂拉回到追名逐利的世俗生活中来。但很多人都知道，人类历史上曾有过一个叫做“生命之夏”的黄金时代，那时的哲学正如柏拉图所说，是“一种高尚的欢愉”。人们对真理的热爱似乎超过了对肉欲和金钱的追求。古人对智慧的这种无以复加的崇尚至今仍残留在我们饥渴的灵魂中。我们一生的大部分时光都在无聊、犹豫中虚度。我们与自己内心和周围环境的纷乱做着散漫的斗争，我们始终有一种信念——只要我们能够剖析自己的灵魂，就会发现我们身上存在着支撑我们生活下去的精神追求。我们应该知道，“对我们来说，生活意味着不断把我们的人格或经历变成熊熊烈火”。我们就像《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》中那个不求荣华富贵，只想为自己的疑问寻找答案的米蒂亚一样。我们需要从整体上把握生活的意义，以使自己摆脱日常生活的漩涡。我们需要在有生之年认清生活的真相，以“永恒的观点”看待那些似乎永恒的事物，我们必须学会以微笑来面对命运。甚至泰然地面对死亡；我们必须成为完整的人，协调各自的欲望，互相配合，达成一个共同的准则。因为人与人之间的通力合作既是伦理学和政治学的最终目标，也可能是逻辑学和形而上学的最终目标。梭罗说过，要做一个哲学家，并不是有深刻的思想，或者去创立一个学派就行了，而是要热爱智慧，并受它的指引去过一种朴素、独立、豁达和充满信心的生活。真理也许不会使我们发财，却能使我们获得自由。

> "Life has meaning," we feel with Browning— "to find its meaning is my meat and drink." So much of our lives is meaningless, a self-cancelling vacillation and futility; we strive with the chaos about us and within; but we would believe all the while that there is something vital and significant in us; could but decipher our own souls.

“生活有其意义”，正如勃朗宁所说，“对它的探求不是英雄梦想，而是一饭一蔬。”生命难寻所谓“意义”，我们优柔寡断，碌碌无为，内心和周遭环境作斗争；但是我们愿意相信，假使能够读懂自己的灵魂，我们身上那种不可或缺、意义重大的东西必将呈现。

- **Meat and drink**： 一饭一蔬。爱情与我，不是什么伟大梦想，是我的一饭一蔬。——《情人》
- **Decipher souls**： 读懂自己的灵魂

> One of those who don't want millions, but an answer to their questions.
我们不想要金山银山，我们想要的是一个答案。

> we want to seize the value and perspective of passing things, and so to pull ourselves up out of the maelstrom of daily circumanstance. We want to know that the little things are little, the big things big before it is too late.
 
我们渴望把握眼前事物的价值和前景，一面陷入日常生活的漩涡。我们希望了解事情的轻重缓急，在我们还来得及的时候。

> We want to seize the value and perspective of passing things.

- 重复式写法
- E.g. We want to know what earth is earth,and human human,before it is too late.
- 我们最大的敌人是时间，冯唐：用文字打败时间。人在面对时间是，都是过客。人的终极只不过是指向时间的尽头

> We want to be whole, to coordinate our energies by criticizing and harmonizing our desires; for coordinated energy: is the last word in ethics and politics, and perhaps in logic and meta-physics too.
- **coordinate desires**:学哲学要调和欲望，不是克制欲望，也就是昨天笔记里所说的“天理即人欲”。

> Seek ya frist the good things of the mind,and the rest will either be supplied or its loss will not be felt.

> "To be a philosopher," said Thoreau, "is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as tp live, according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust." We may be sure that if we can but find wisdom, all things else will be added unto us. "Seek ye first the good things of the mind," Bacon admonishes us, "and the rest will either be sup- plied or its loss will not be felt." Truth will not make us rich, but it will make us free.

索罗告诉我们：“作为一个哲学家。不仅需要具备缜密的思维或建立某一学派的能力，还要热爱智慧，过一种简单，独立，宽容，信任的生活。” 我们愿意相信，若能找到真的智慧，那我们的生命将不再盲目。“首先去追求思想中那些美好的内容吧，”培根告诫，“其余的部分即使不是接踵而至，也会在失去时不觉可惜。”真理无法帮助我们富有，但却能使我们自由。

- 找到你脑海中最美好的事情，要么所有的事情都回来，要不丢失事情后也不会怅然若失。君子务本，本立而道生。
- 真理不会让我们有钱，但能让我们做一个自由而无用的灵魂。

> Some ungentle reader will check us here by informing us that philosophy is as useless as chess, as obscure as ignorance, and as stagnant as content. "There is nothing so absurd," said Cicero, "but that it may be found in the books of the philosophers." Doubtless some philosophers have had all sorts of wisdom except common sense; and many a philosophic flight has been due to the elevating power of thin air. Let us resolve, on this voyage of ours, to put in only at the ports of light, to keep out of the muddy streams of metaphysics and the "many-sounding seas" of theological dispute. But is philpsophy stagnant? Science seems always to advance, while philosophy seems always to lose ground. Yet this is only because philosophy accepts the hard and hazardous task of dealing with problems not yet open to the methods of science -- problems like good and evil, beauty and ugliness, order and freedom, life and death; so soon as a field of inquiry yields, knowledge susceptible of exact formulation it is called science. Every science begins as philosophy and ends as art; it arises in hypothesis and flows into achievement. Philpspphy is a hypothetical interpretation of the unknown (as in metaphysics), or of the inexactly known (as in ethiqs or political philosophy); it is the front trench in the siege of truth. Science is the captured territory; and behind it are those secure regions in which knowledge and art build our imperfect and marvelous world. Philosophy seems to stand still, perplexed but only because she leaves the fruits of victory to her daughters the sciences, and herself passes on, divinely discontent, to the uncertain and unexplored.

可能有的读者会毫不客气地打断我们说，哲学晦涩艰深得近乎愚昧，就像国际象棋一样不实用。西塞罗说过，“再也沒有比在哲学家的著作中看到的东西更为荒诞的了”。在我们的这次航行中，让我们避开形而上学的漩涡，避开神学争论那喧嚣的海洋，而只在光明的港湾停泊。科学似乎一直在前进，而哲学則似乎在节节败退。不过这只是因为哲学所要解决的问题都是科学方法还无法证明的，诸如善与恶、美与丑、生与死、秩序与自由等，而这是一项十分艰难的任务。某个研究领域一旦产生了可以用精确的公式来表示的知识，它就进入了科学的行列。每一门科学都是从哲学开始，以艺术结束的。它源于假设，终于丰硕的成果。哲学是对未知事物(如在形而上学中)或不能确切认识的事物(如在伦理学或政治哲学中)的假设性诠释，它是追求真理的先锋，科学是被它占领的土地，它后面是稳定的区域。知识和艺术在那里缔造了我们这个虽不完美却非常奇妙的世界。看起来，哲学似乎陷入了迷惘，那是因为她总把胜利的果实留给自己的女儿-科学，自己却永不满足地去探索未知的领域。

> Shall we be more technical P Science is analytical description, philosophy is synthetic interpretation. Science wishes to resfclve the wholfe into parts, the organism into organs, the obscure into the known. It does not inquire into the values and ideal possibilities of things, nor into their total and final significance; it is content to show their present actuality and operation, it narrows its gaze resolutely to the nature and process of things as they are* The scientist is as impartial as Nature in Turgenev's po&n: he is as interested in the leg df a flea as in the creative throes of a genius. But the philos- opher is not content to describe the fact; he wishes to ascertain its relation to experience in general, and thereby to get at its meaning and its worth ; he combines things in interpretive synthesis; he tries to put together* better than before, that great universe-watch which the inquisitive scientist has analytically taken apart. Science tells us how to heal and how to kill; it reduces the death rate in retail and then kills us wholesale in war; but only wisdom—desire coordinated in the light of all experience—can tell us when to heal and when to kill. To observe processes and to construct means is science; to criticize and coordinate ends is philosophy: and because ill these days our means and instruments have multiplied beyond our interpretation and synthesis of ideals and ends, our life is full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. For a fact is nothing except in relation to desire; it is not complete except in relation to a purpose and a whole. Science without phi- losophy, facts without perspective and valuation, cannot save us from havoc and despair. Science gives us knowledge, but only philosophy can give us wisdom.

能不能让我们的学术气氛再浓一些?科学是分析说明，而哲学是综合解释；科学总是化整为零，把有机体分解成器官，把晦涩转化为明晰。它不管事物的价值、理想的可能性，也不管它们的终极意义，只是满足于说明它们的现状和作用，只专注于事物本身的性质和运动过程。科学家就像屠格涅夫诗中的大自然那样一视同仁地对待事物——对一只跳蚤的腿和对一位天才创作时的痛苦抱着同样的兴趣。但是，哲学家却并不满足于描述事实，他希望弄清楚事实与经验的普遍关系，从而把握它的意义与价值。他抓住事物之间的联系，进行综合解释。他尽力把被好奇的科学家像拆钟表一样地拆开的宇宙再重新组装在一起，而且要比过去更好。科学教给我们如何救人和杀人，它一点点地降低了死亡率，却又在战争中把我们大批地杀死。只有智慧这种按照全部经验进行过协调的愿望，才能告诉我们何时救人、何时杀人。科学观察运动过程，设想解决的方法：哲学则对目的进行评议和协调。正因为我们目前的方法和工具在不断地增多，远远超过了我们对理想与目的的解释，我们的生活才会喧嚣不安，却又没有什么意义。因为事实如果不与愿望产生联系便毫无价值，除非与目的和整体发生关系，否则，仅有事实是不够的。只有科学而没有哲学，只有事实而没有价值观和对未来的展望，是不能把我们从劫难和绝望中拯救出来的。

- 科学予人以生死，救黎民于灾病，毁城池于旦夕。唯有智慧——那从现世水火中诞生的欲望和热切，才能告诉我们：何时予人生的希望，何时给人死的安详。科学的目的是探索过程、构建方法；哲学的目的是批判怀疑、寻找真理。而现实是：人类的方法与工具已远超过我们对这个世界的认识和对真理的思考。人生充满喧哗与骚动，却没有任何意义。
- 别写 With the development of science and technology, 而要写:
In these days our means and instruments have multiplied beyond our interpretation and synthesis of ideals and ends,our life is full of sound and fury,signifying nothing.

- Do you know? the secret of the true scholar? In every man there is something wherein I may learn of him;and in that I am his pupil.你知道吗，什么是老师？三人行必有我师焉。不耻下问。

Specifically, philosophy means and includes five fields o£ Study and discourse: logic, esthetics, ethics, politics, and metaphysics. *Logic* is the study of ideal method in thought and research: observation and introspection, deduction and induction, hypothesis and experiment, analysis and synthesis-such are the forms of human activity which logic tries to understand and guide; it is a dull study for most of us, and yet the great events in the history of thought are the improvements men have made in their methods of thinking and research. *Esthetics* is the study of ideal form, or beauty ; it is the philosophy of art. Ethics is the study of ideal conduct; the highest knowledge, said Socrates, is the knowledge of good and evil, the knowledge of the wisdom of life. *Politics* is the study of ideal social organization (it is not, as one might suppose, the art and science of capturing and keeping office) ; monarchy, aristocracy, democracy, socialism, anarchism, feminism—these ;are the dramatis persona? of political philosophy. And lastly,*metaphysics* (which gets into so much trouble because it is not, like the other forms of philosophy, an attempt to coordinate the real in the light of the ideal); is the study of the "ultimate reality"of all things: of the real and final nature of "matter" (ontology), of "mind" (philosophical psychology), and of the interrelation of "mind" and "matter" in the processes of perception and knowledge (epitemology)

8.We may flatter ourselves with thought that when genius speak to us we feel a ghostly reminiscence of having ourselves ,in our distant youth,had vaguely this selfsame thought which genius now speaks,but which we had not art or courage to clothe with form and utterance.我们会有这样的感觉：在我们青年时候是有一些模糊的想法，但是表述能力太Low，只有天才才能将那些想法表达出来，你如果读到这些天才的话语，你会感到洋洋自得。
9.Genius hears the overtones，and the music of the spheres;genius knows what Pythagoras（毕达哥拉斯：看满天的繁星，可以听到音乐的变化） menat when he said that philosophy is the highest music.
天才可以听出弦外之音和宇宙中的音乐；天才知道哲学是最高形式的音乐。
